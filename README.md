# TrafficSimulator
Traffic simulator

Traffic simulator with the following characteristics:

Environment
● The environment can be represented by anything you want

Vehicles
● Vehicles should drive on roads.
● The side on which vehicles drive is not important - either left or right will do.
● Vehicles do not have to be physics-based, but can be if you want them to.
● Vehicles should obey the laws of the road
  ○ keep a safe following distance to other vehicles.
  ○ yield to other traffic at intersections.
  ○ yield to pedestrians at zebra crossings.
● Note that vehicles do not need to decide whether or not to turn left/right at intersections -
they may follow fixed routes if this makes things easier.

Overall project is not physics based. Overall functionality is solid but can be improved.

It should be noted that the project focused on being scalable rather than having all functionality working as intended.
